# Automated Scale Project

## Overview

The Automated Scale project, completed in May 2023, involves the creation of a system that automates weight measurement and stores the readings alongside corresponding images. The system is designed to accurately record all measurements, filter out noise, and determine a single representative weight for up to two objects on the scale at once. The device is battery-powered and can operate for one week on a single charge.

## Features

- **Automated Weight Measurement**: Continuously records weight readings while objects are on the scale.
- **Noise Filtering**: Filters out spurious noise to determine a single representative weight.
- **Multiple Object Measurement**: Capable of measuring the weight of up to two objects simultaneously.
- **Battery Powered**: Runs for one week on a single charge.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Implementation**: Contains the implementation file for the automated scale system.
- **Testing**: Includes the necessary files to test the Arduino and system functionality.

## Setup and Usage

### Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board
- Weight sensors
- Battery (capable of powering the system for one week)
- Camera module (for capturing images of objects on the scale) - ESP32CAM

### Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Necessary Arduino libraries for weight sensors and camera module

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-scale.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `Implementation` folder and open the project files in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.

### Testing

1. Navigate to the `Testing` folder and open the project files in the Arduino IDE.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
